## Introduction
**Jarvis** is a powerful and interactive virtual assistant developed using Python. Inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man movies, Jarvis listens to your commands and performs various tasks to make your daily life easier. From managing your music library to providing weather updates and news, Jarvis is designed to assist you with a wide range of activities.

## Features
- **Voice Activation:** Jarvis wakes up when you say "Jarvis" and listens for commands after responding with "Yes sir."
- **Music Library Management:** Add and control your music library through voice commands.
- **News Updates:** Stay updated with the latest news.
- **Weather Updates:** Get real-time weather information.
- **Task Automation:** Perform various tasks through voice commands.
- **Integration with OpenAI API:** Leverages the power of OpenAI for advanced conversational capabilities.

## Installation
To get started with Jarvis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mayukh-Ganguly01/jarvis-virtual-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-virtual-assistant
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Get an OpenAI API key:**
   Sign up on OpenAI and get your API key.
6. **Configure your API key:**
   Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
  ```sh
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  ```
## Usage 
To start using Jarvis, run the following command:
```sh
python jarvis.py
